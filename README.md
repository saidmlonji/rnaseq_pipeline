Overview
This repository hosts an end-to-end RNA-seq pipeline. It starts with FASTQ data and ends with differential expression results and gene-level visuals. It uses Bowtie2 for alignment, SAMtools for file handling, and R with DESeq2 and Gviz for statistics and visualization. The pipeline is modular. You can run it as a whole or run individual steps.

What this project does
- Accepts raw FASTQ data and a sample sheet that defines groups and conditions.
- Performs quality control and optional trimming.
- Aligns reads to a reference genome using Bowtie2.
- Converts, sorts, and indexes alignments with SAMtools.
- Quantifies gene expression with a counting tool.
- Analyzes differential expression with DESeq2.
- Produces plots and interactive visualizations with Gviz and base R plots.
- Outputs a clear, shareable report and a complete results package.

Key concepts
- FASTQ: raw sequence reads that feed the pipeline.
- Alignment: mapping reads to a reference genome.
- BAM/SAM: formats for aligned reads.
- Counting: assigning reads to genes or features.
- Differential expression: comparing expression across conditions.
- Visualization: showing results with genome views and plots.

  - Optional: Python for wrapper utilities.
- Quick start plan:
  - Install the required tools or pull a container image.
  - Prepare a small sample dataset to test the pipeline.
  - Create a minimal configuration file.

How the pipeline runs
- Step 1: Quality control
  - Run FastQC on all FASTQ files.
  - Compile reports with MultiQC.
- Step 2: Preprocessing (optional)
  - Trim adapters and filter low-quality reads (if configured).
  - Re-run QC on cleaned data.
- Step 3: Alignment
  - Bowtie2 aligns reads to the reference genome.
  - Generate SAM files and convert to sorted BAM files with SAMtools.
- Step 4: Post-alignment processing
  - Mark duplicates if needed.
  - Index BAM files for fast access.
- Step 5: Counting
  - Use a gene annotation to count reads mapping to genes.
  - Produce a counts matrix with samples as columns and genes as rows.
- Step 6: Differential expression
  - Load the counts into R.
  - Run DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes.
  - Save results with key statistics (log2 fold change, p-value, adjusted p-value).
- Step 7: Visualization
  - Generate genome tracks with Gviz.
  - Produce plots for sample relationships, dispersion estimates, and DEG lists.
- Step 8: Reporting
  - Create a comprehensive report summarizing QC, alignment metrics, counts, DEG results, and visualizations.
- Step 9: Packaging
  - Package outputs for sharing with collaborators or submitting to a repository.

Examples and tutorials
- Beginner walk-through
  - Use the included small dataset to run the pipeline end-to-end.
  - Validate each step with basic QC metrics and simple counts.
- Intermediate scenario
  - Add a second condition, adjust the design matrix, and re-run differential expression.
  - Compare results across runs and interpret the changes.
- Advanced scenario
  - Integrate a custom annotation, apply a custom contrast, or add a post-analysis step with additional plots.
- Step-by-step notes
  - Each tutorial includes a checklist: inputs present, config valid, memory limits adequate, and outputs examined.

Performance and scalability
- Parallelism
  - The pipeline supports multi-threading for alignment, counting, and summaries.
  - Use HPC-friendly options to request more CPUs when available.
- Memory usage
  - Bowtie2 and BAM processing require substantial memory for large genomes.
  - Plan for peak memory during alignment and counting.
- Large datasets
  - Break data into batches if needed.
  - Run QC on a per-sample basis to identify outliers early.
- Scaling tips
  - Use distributed file systems for data storage.
  - Keep reference indices on fast storage to speed up access.

Troubleshooting
- Common issues
  - Bowtie2 not found: ensure the binary is on PATH or use the container image.
  - Reference index missing: verify the bowtie2_index path in the config.
  - GTF/GFF mismatch: confirm the annotation matches the genome build.
  - Insufficient permissions: check read/write permissions on output directories.
- Debug steps
  - Run a single step manually with a small sample to isolate the problem.
  - Check log files for error messages and stack traces.
  - Validate sample metadata before starting the run.
- Logging
  - The pipeline writes a log file per run with all commands and timings.
  - Review logs to understand failures and recoveries.

Testing and quality assurance
- Automated tests
  - A lightweight test suite runs a small sample to verify that all steps complete.
  - Tests cover configuration parsing, basic file existence checks, and a minimal end-to-end run.
- CI integration
  - A CI workflow runs tests on push and pull requests.
  - Checks include environment consistency and basic output validation.
- Code quality
  - The project uses linting for shell and R scripts.
  - Style guidelines help keep scripts readable and maintainable.

Security and data privacy
- Data handling
  - The pipeline processes sensitive sequencing data; protect source data.
  - Prefer local runs or controlled storage when handling real datasets.
- Access controls
  - Restrict access to data directories and results.
  - Use signed containers and verify image integrity before use.
- Dependencies
  - Pin tool versions to reduce drift and vulnerabilities.
  - Regularly update and audit dependencies.

FAQ
- Q: Can I run this on Windows?
  - A: The pipeline is designed for Unix-like systems. Use a Linux VM or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you must run on Windows.
- Q: Do I need internet access during a run?
  - A: For most runs, you need file access to reference genomes, indices, and tools. If you preinstall dependencies, the run itself can be offline.
- Q: Can I swap tools (e.g., HTSeq for counting) with this pipeline?
  - A: Yes, the counting step can be configured to use alternative tools. Update the config to select the desired backend.
- Q: How do I add my own annotations?
  - A: Provide a compatible GTF/GFF file and align it with the reference genome. Update the config to point to the new annotation.

Future directions
